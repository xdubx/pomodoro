    <h1>Why use üçÖ?</h1>
    <p class="content__text">
      The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
      Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into
      intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each
      interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after
      the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
